    We were looking for a simplified way to be able to package up the Kubernetes infrastructure – to be able to set it up, to manage it, provide all
    the underlying tool sets – so we picked a partner that knows how to do this. It’s a build versus buy decision; we decided to go with people where Kubernetes is their core competency.

    Teleport simplified our remote terminal access procedures. SSH to an AWS cloud instance is not a headache anymore. Through the Teleport Web UI, developers are no longer required to remember the random instance's IP address or the meaningless hostname. It is as easy as browsing a website now. Also, Teleport makes our security audit job easier. It is now just like watching a video!

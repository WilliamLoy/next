  <ListItem icon="balance">
    ### Balance

    We approach each other, our work, our customers, and our community with the understanding that we are running a marathon and not a sprint. We understand everyone has many priorities and responsibilities, and we are strong supporters of work/life balance. We understand that true productivity is only achievable with balance — mind, body, and spirit.

  </ListItem>
  <ListItem icon="humility">
    ### Humility

    We're not arrogant, and we don’t have big personalities; instead, we believe that our work product should speak for itself. We are open to other ideas and value and respect every team member’s experiences and contributions. We do have strong opinions, loosely held, but we are never too proud to admit we were wrong or too opinionated to not listen to a different side.

  </ListItem>
  <ListItem icon="honesty">
    ### Honesty

    Honesty isn’t always easy. We have the courage to own up to our individual mistakes or take a stand in the industry as a team, even against popular opinion. We are direct in our opinions and advice.

  </ListItem>
  <ListItem icon="transparency">
    ### Transparency

    We write things down and share everything we do across the company. We believe that information silos breed politics and are the antithesis of productivity.

  </ListItem>
  <ListItem icon="thoughtulness">
    ### Thoughtfulness

    Our industry is prone to fashionable trends. We dig into the details, write down our options, and collaborate on our course of action. We value thoughtfulness over speed.

  <ListItem icon="sickLeaveVocation">
    ### Sick Leave and Vacation

    Spending time with family and friends, taking care of personal stuff, traveling, taking a vacation, and most importantly resting are critically important to health, wellness, and productivity. Flexibility and generosity in time off and sick leave allow for the opportunity for helping our team members to be at their best.

  <ListItem icon="profDevelopment">
    ### Professional Development

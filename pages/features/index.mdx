      >
        Managing static SSH keys can lead to increased operational overhead and
        may lead to security vulnerabilities. The industry best practice is to
        use certificate-based authentication for SSH and Kubernetes.

        Restricting access and granting specific permissions through role-based
        access controls is the first step to securing your infrastructure. The
        next step is to log all activity across your infrastructure.

      >
        Privileged session recording, or SSH session recording, means recording
        the user’s actual screen during their SSH session for real-time or later
        playback.

      >
        Teleport’s “Trusted Clusters” capability allows organizations to
        partition their infrastructure and grant access to each other. Managed
        service providers and contract-based DevOps teams take advantage of
        Teleport’s Trusted Clusters to manage servers for their clients.

        title="Kubernetes Access Management"
      >
        Teleport works by being a unified gateway for both Kubernetes and SSH
        sessions. This allows to synchronize SSO, role-based access controls and
        audit logging for both protocols.

        Teleport integrates into an existing company identity management. This
        allows DevOps, developers and other end-users to access computing
        infrastructure via the same SSO policy.

      >
        Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the practice of managing privileged
        access to infrastructure through a central directory of users, roles,
        and teams. Authorization is granted to groups (or roles) within a
        company directory.

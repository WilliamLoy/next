We are not liable for any damage or loss due to unauthorized account access resulting from your actions or actions of your Authorized Users. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or your account, or if any passwords are lost, stolen or disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or your account may have otherwise been compromised, you agree to notify us immediately at support@goteleport.com.

When you purchase a Production License (each such purchase, a “Transaction”), you will be asked to supply additional information relevant to such Transaction, which may include, without limitation, your credit-card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your address(es) for billing (such information, “Payment Information”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information, whether you provide it in the course of a Transaction or in connection with your account. You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your Payment Information. You must promptly update all information to keep your Payment Information current, complete and accurate, and you must promptly notify us if your payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security. If the payment card you provide expires or you do not maintain accurate and up to date payment card information, we reserve the right to cancel the Services and your account without further notice and delete Your User Content.

All fees are due as per the payment terms specified in the payment plan you select when purchasing your Production License or your Sales Order, as applicable, and shall be deemed non-refundable upon payment.

All fees specifically exclude (and you are responsible for) any and all applicable sales, use and other taxes, other than taxes based on Gravitational’s income.

All terms herein, in the payment plan you select when purchasing your Production License, in a Sales Order or separate license agreement, including without limitation, any pricing terms, are confidential, and you agree not to disclose them to any third party. All fees are payable in the currency of the United States of America.

Payment processing may be handled by third-party payment processors (each a “Payment Processor”). You may be required to register with the Payment Processor, agree to terms of service of the Payment Processor and go through a vetting process at the request of the Payment Processor to set up your account with the Payment Processor. Please note that Gravitational is not a party to such terms of service or any payment agreement between you and the Payment Processor and that Gravitational has no obligations or liability to you under such agreements.

During your use of the Services and for one (1) year thereafter, Gravitational or its designated agent may one time per six (6) month period inspect your facilities and records to verify your compliance with these Terms and any applicable Sales Order. Any such inspection will take place only during your normal business hours and upon not less than ten (10) business days’ prior written notice from Gravitational. You shall reasonably cooperate with such audit and shall make such personnel, facilities and records available as Gravitational may reasonably request. Gravitational will give you written notice of any non-compliance, including any use of the Software or services beyond that authorized under these Terms and applicable Sales Order and without limiting Gravitational’s remedies arising from such unauthorized use, you shall promptly: (i) cease such unauthorized use and (ii) pay Gravitational any additional fees due to the extent your use of the Software has exceeded the scope purchased by you. If any underpayment exceeds 5% then you will also pay the costs reasonably incurred by Gravitational in connection with the inspection.

We reserve the right to refuse to allow any User Content on the Services, or to edit or remove any User Content at any time without prior notice if we reasonably believe that you or Your User Content are in violation of these Terms or otherwise disrupt or threaten the operation of the Services. We comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and will remove User Content from the Services upon receipt of a compliant takedown notice (see the Section titled “Copyright Policy” below). You agree to immediately take down any User Content that violates these Terms, including in response to a request from us. We additionally reserve the right to directly take down such User Content or to suspend or terminate your use of the Services in our sole discretion.

You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against us with respect to any User Content. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

## Confidentiality

You acknowledge that Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) is a valuable, special and unique asset of Gravitational and agree that you will (i) hold the Confidential Information in confidence and to take reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information (including, without limitation, all precautions you employ with respect to your own confidential materials), (ii) not make any use whatsoever at any time of such Confidential Information except to perform your obligations under these Terms, (iii) not export or re-export (within the meaning of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations) any such Confidential Information or product thereof and (iv) not disclose, transfer, use (or seek to induce others to disclose, transfer or use) any Confidential Information for any purpose other than using the Services in accordance with these Terms. If relevant, you may disclose the Confidential Information to your authorized employees and agents provided they are also bound to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information. You shall promptly notify us in writing of any circumstances which may constitute unauthorized disclosure, transfer, or use of Confidential Information. You shall use best efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure, transfer or use. You shall return all originals and any copies of any and all materials containing Confidential Information to Gravitational upon termination of these Terms for any reason whatsoever.

The term “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all of Gravitational’s trade secrets, confidential and proprietary information, all other information and data of Gravitational’s that is not generally known to the public or other third parties who could derive value, economic or otherwise, from its use or disclosure, or which a reasonable person would consider the information to be confidential, given its nature and the circumstances surrounding disclosure. Confidential Information shall be deemed to include technical, financial, strategic and other proprietary and confidential information relating to Gravitational, Gravitational’s business, operations and properties, including information about Gravitational’s staff, users or partners, or other business information disclosed directly or indirectly in writing, orally or by drawings or observation. You acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, which breach may result in irreparable harm to Gravitational, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, Gravitational shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law.

## General Legal Terms

These Terms, and any applicable Sales Order or license agreement between you and Gravitational constitute the whole legal agreement between you and us and govern your use of the Services and completely replace any prior agreements between you and us in relation to the Services, including prior versions of these Terms. In the event of conflict between these Terms, a Sales Order or any written license agreement between Gravitational and you, such Sales Order or license agreement shall take precedence over these Terms, unless otherwise specified in such Sales Order or license agreement. Should any provision of these Terms be found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms shall still apply.

There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.

You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services or our website at our sole discretion. By providing us your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.

You agree that if we don’t exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these Terms (or of which we have the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a waiver of our rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to us.

These Terms, and your relationship with us under these Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of San Francisco, California to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms.

You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

title: The Path to Environment-free Computing
description: "Despite advances in software development tooling and the maturing of DevOps, today’s cloud applications and infrastructure are excessively complex and increasingly fragile. Unlike desktop and mobile applications, cloud-native software requires 24⁄7 monitoring and management. This is due largely to the rise of API-driven infrastructure, increased complexity in application architecture, fragmentation of computing environments, and industry reliance on legacy remote management protocols inherited from the client-server era."

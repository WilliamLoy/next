title: Best Practices for Secure Infrastructure Access
description: "As compute resources change dynamically and communicate via public networks, the current implementation of access controls and policy enforcement is becoming an increasingly inexact science. This whitepaper takes a deep look at these trends, the challenges posed by relying on a purely networking-based security policy, and how to reframe this problem in a realistic light. Distilled into key principles used by engineers from small startups to Fortune 5 companies, these four practices provide a strong framework in reconsidering how companies authenticate and authorize users access to critical infrastructure."
